# PROJECT FRNN


## Description
This project uses an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) to generate text. 
The text this generates, is the tweet that shall be posted.


## Precautions
Any generated text will be scanned against a word list of offensive words.
If the generated text passes the word check without any offensive words detected, it will be uploaded to the ![@FRNN_AI](https://twitter.com/@FRNN_AI) Twitter account.

If you see this project and the AI has tweeted something offensive and / or something that you think should not be tweeted, 
please tell me at my contacts below. Thank you for reading!
